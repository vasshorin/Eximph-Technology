      description: 'Eximph Technologies offers the FB, FBG and FBGP series fluid bed dryers. These machines are designed for pelletizing substances and drying the resulting granules as well as mixing the substances in a fluidized bed. The dryers of the presented series differ in their functionality and purpose, FB series: drying of granulate, FBG series: drying and granulation, FBGP series: drying and production of granulate, coating of granulate and production of pellets. This equipment is widely used in the pharmaceutical and food industry, as well as the production of dietary supplements and compound feeds.',
      advantages: ' BENEFITS Drying, granulation and casing processes are extremely important in the production of solids because the loss of auxiliary substances and active, expensive ingredients must be minimized during the processes. Fluidized bed drying is the most efficient method of drying solids. In this process, the liquid is removed from the surface of each pellet. Fluid bed drying has undoubted and obvious advantages: excellent heat transfer, ideal drying times, gentle and efficient product processing, which is especially important for temperature-sensitive materials. In addition, the fluidized bed principle allows drying under delicate conditions, without damaging the granule structure, and ensures uniform drying of the granulate layer.',
