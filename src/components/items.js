      description: 'Eximph Technologies offers the FB, FBG and FBGP series fluid bed dryers. These machines are designed for pelletizing substances and drying the resulting granules as well as mixing the substances in a fluidized bed. The dryers of the presented series differ in their functionality and purpose, FB series: drying of granulate, FBG series: drying and granulation, FBGP series: drying and production of granulate, coating of granulate and production of pellets. This equipment is widely used in the pharmaceutical and food industry, as well as the production of dietary supplements and compound feeds.',
      advantages: ' BENEFITS Drying, granulation and casing processes are extremely important in the production of solids because the loss of auxiliary substances and active, expensive ingredients must be minimized during the processes. Fluidized bed drying is the most efficient method of drying solids. In this process, the liquid is removed from the surface of each pellet. Fluid bed drying has undoubted and obvious advantages: excellent heat transfer, ideal drying times, gentle and efficient product processing, which is especially important for temperature-sensitive materials. In addition, the fluidized bed principle allows drying under delicate conditions, without damaging the granule structure, and ensures uniform drying of the granulate layer.',

      description: 'Exmiph Pharmacy offers wet granulation mixers. These mixers are designed for mixing substances and powdered materials and their subsequent granulation for the production of medicines. The use of this equipment is relevant for companies in the pharmaceutical, chemical, food, ceramic industries, as well as for the production of products from metal powders.',
      advantages: "Availability of a conical material container. Automatic system of raising the lid of the tank by means of a pneumatic cylinder. The presence of the jacket of the main tank, which allows to heat or cool the product during its processing (Optional). Frequency regulation of the mixer drive motors, which provides an optimum selection of mixer and chopper speed depending on the complexity of the product. The presence of an air filter that prevents the ingress of substance dust into the room. The presence of a central control system with a touch screen and a programmable logic controller, provides clear and easy control of the technological process. The design and compact size of the mixer reduce power consumption by up to 20% and save expensive space in the room. High-quality polishing (0.5 microns) on the inner surface of the mixer. Safety in operation: presence of locks on the main and exit hatches of the mixer, as well as automatic cut-off of drives power when any of these hatches is opened. Surfaces in contact with the product are made of high quality alloy steel AISI304;"

      description: 'The C&C200G series is the latest model with an advanced design.  They have the dual function of dedusting and moving pellets from bottom to top. The inlet of the dedusting machine can be adjusted to the output height of any model of tablet press, the output is combined with metal detector. In this way, a production line can be assembled to ensure the dedusting and lifting of tablets as well as metal detecting.',
      advantages: 'The housing and hood of the machine have a block design. The height of the pellet outlet is easily adjustable. The machines inlet and outlet are rotatable (360 degrees), which makes the production process convenient and allows for maximum economy of working space. Quick-assembly and disassembly reliable design. High capacity, enables production of large batches of different types of tablets 3-35 mm in diameter. All parts in contact with pellets are made of stainless steel 316L. The design of the dedusting machine has no "dead zones" which makes its cleaning efficient and fully meets the requirements of GMP. The reliable drive ensures stable and low-noise operation. Distinctive features of the machine are polishing pellets on both sides, high dedusting efficiency, modern design and easy transportation.'
